# Step 4
# This script will search for all instances having a tag with "Backup" or "backup"
# on it. As soon as we have the instances list, we loop through each instance
# and reference the AMIs of that instance. We check that the latest daily backup
# succeeded then we store every image that's reached its DeleteOn tag's date for
# deletion. We then loop through the AMIs, deregister them and remove all the
# snapshots associated with that AMI.

# searches for ec2 instances with tag (not value) of Backup or backup.
